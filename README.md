# CS-385
CS 385 is a course on the design and analysis of algorithms. It covers asymptotic complexity analysis, space-time tradeoffs, standard algorithm design techniques, and classic algorithms that serve as examples of design techniques. This course also develops C++ language programming skills by implementing graph algorithms, numerical algorithms, and complex search and sort algorithms.
